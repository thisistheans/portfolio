                <p class="portfolio">MyRehab is a concept mobile application designed for rehabilitation patients. Based
                    on my personal experience working in a physiotherapy clinic, I noticed that patients often did not
                    keep up with their prescribed exercises for various reasons: forgetting, laziness, losing their
                    instruction sheet, not seeing improvement, and more. This impeded their recovery and made it
                    difficult for their clinicians to assess the patient's progress as well as the effectiveness of the
                    prescribed exercises. To solve these problems, I conceptualized a mobile app called MyRehab.
                    <br><br>
                    MyRehab features:</p>
                    <li>stores the patients' prescribed exercises</li>
                    <li>sends reminders</li>
                    <li>allows the user to log their exercise progress, in addition to daily pain</li>
                    <li>provides data visualizations for their progress</li>
                    <li>celebrates little milestones</li>
                    <br>
                    <p class="portfolio">
                    By providing visual and physical means to view their journey over time, coupled with celebratory
                    milestones, patients are encouraged to follow their rehabilitation plan. Moreover, the app also
                    benefits clinicians during patient visits by providing data to assess the patient's progress outside
                    of therapy sessionsâ€”allowing for improved rehabilitation plans that are specific to the patient.
                    Together, these factors benefit the healthcare system by encouraging patient and clinician
                    engagement for rehabilitation.
